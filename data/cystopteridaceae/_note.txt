The "firstVersions" alignments are the ones that CJR sent to WF originally. In them, the
regions that were set for exclusion have not been excluded.

CJR realized this on Aug9, and made the new set of alignments that have those regions
excluded (otherwise the two sets of alignments are the same)

./abioscripts --seqconcat --applyexcludes --outputsingles --filenames *.nex --outputfile abio_outputfiles


The "finalVersions_sequencesRenamed" versions have the sequence names (the ones that are 
subject to swapping) changed to be more interpretable. E.g.,
	A_tai_6137_A  	renamed to	6137_copy1

The tree-tip names will then be changed to, e.g., A_taiwaniana_6137_A

The notation for the new names:
	Multiple "species" with the same name (ie undescribed cryptic species) are indicated with "sp1", "sp2" etc suffixes
	Multiple "allele individuals" from the same diploid accesions are indicated with "a", "b", etc, after the db#
