				b1			b4
frag sp1		2 1 2 1		1 1 2 2 	All max PP; topologies different
tas										phasing identical, topologies different
dry (appVers)	2 b 1 2 	2 1 1 2
dry ("other")	b 1 b b 	b b b 3		gap and pgi max PP in both, topologies very different
dry (dis1)		b 2 b 1		b 3 b b 	The two dis drys are close topologically, vary across runs
dry (dis2)		1 3 2 3		1 2 2 1
dis				1 2 1 b		1 1 1 b		in b1 only IBR max PP, 3loci max in b4

Aside from these cases, even the weak phasing tends to be the same across the two runs

The rate multipliers for these two runs are quite different, with b1 being higher for all three than b4. 
Maybe removing those parameters will help with convergence
