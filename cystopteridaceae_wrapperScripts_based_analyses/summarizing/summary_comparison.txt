Aside from these cases, even the weak phasing tends to be the same across the two runs

The rate multipliers for the two b runs are quite different, with b1 being higher for all three than b4. 
Maybe removing those parameters will help with convergence

The "good" and "bad" e runs each match the "good" b run for the phasing that differed between the b runs
So will do a separate summary for the e runs, to see what the differences there are:
				e2(bd)		e3(gd)		b1(good)
cont (appish)	1 1 1 1		2 1 2 1		2 1 2 1
rob (deep)		2 2 1 1		1 2 2 1		1 2 2 1
remot			2 1 2 2		1 1 1 2		1 1 1 2

Gymno topologies different (what is sister to oya, position of "deep" robertianum, etc).
So a new batch of misbehaviours! but the former misbehaviours disappeared (entirely), so
maybe upping the weights on the phasing proposals did the trick? (Also, encouraging that the
good b run exactly matches the good e run for these ones, and the b1 and e3 topologies are
identical -- the two disjunctum "individuals" even fall in the same place as the phased tips
in the b run)
