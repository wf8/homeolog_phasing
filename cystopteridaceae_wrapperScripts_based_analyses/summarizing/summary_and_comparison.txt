See the "_note_SummaryOfRuns" doc in the output directory for a description of what each
model/run is


				b1(good)	b4(bad)		e2(bd)		e3(gd)		b1vb4
frag sp1		2 1 2 1		1 1 2 2 	2 1 2 1		2 1 2 1		All max PP; topologies different
tas																phasing identical, topologies different
dry (appVers)	2 b 1 2 	2 1 1 2					2 b 1 2 
dry ("other")	b 1 b b 	b b b 3		b 1 b b		b 1 b b		gap and pgi max PP in both, topologies very different
dry (dis1)		b 2 b 1		b 3 b b 	b 2 b 1		b 2 b 1 	The two dis drys are close topologically, vary across runs
dry (dis2)		1 3 2 3		1 2 2 1		1 3 2 3		1 3 2 3
dis				1 2 1 b		1 1 1 b		NA			NA			in b1 only IBR max PP, 3loci max in b4
		
Aside from these cases, even the weak phasing tends to be the same across the two runs

The rate multipliers for the two b runs are quite different, with b1 being higher for all three than b4. 
Maybe removing those parameters will help with convergence

The "good" and "bad" e runs each match the "good" b run for the phasing that differed between the b runs
So will do a separate summary for the e runs, to see what the differences there are:
				e2(bd)		e3(gd)		b1(good)	g2
cont (appish)	1 1 1 1		2 1 2 1		2 1 2 1		2 1 2 1
rob (deep)		2 2 1 1		1 2 2 1		1 2 2 1		1 2 2 1
remot			2 1 2 2		1 1 1 2		1 1 1 2		1 1 1 2

Gymno topologies different (what is sister to oya, position of "deep" robertianum, etc).
So a new batch of misbehaviours! but the former misbehaviours disappeared (entirely), so
maybe upping the weights on the phasing proposals did the trick? (Also, encouraging that the
good b run exactly matches the good e run for these ones, and the b1 and e3 topologies are
identical -- the two disjunctum "individuals" even fall in the same place as the phased tips
in the b run)

g2 has the good Gymnocarpium configuration, but the bad C.frag sp1 one (actually, Cystopteris bad in general?)

e3 versus g2 shows a potential problem. xCysto and C.frag2 are closely related, so the loci
in their two tips get quickly phased with respect to each other, but then they're stuck? Ie,
once the two pairs of tips is phased, no individual locus can accept a swap, even if the loci are 
not phased to each other? Any switch for an individual locus would make a strong conflict with
the xCysto-Cfrag1 topology, even if it matched the rest of the tree better? (ie, was actually
phased correctly). Fixing this problem would require not only joint topology/phase moves, but
joint across the two accessions?

Should I drop C.frag2 from the analysis?



mdl1.2i comparisons -- the runs without C.frag sp2
	2i3 is best, closely followed by 2i4, then by 2i1 and then 2i2
	
				2i3		2i4		2i1		2i2
dry ~app		2b12	2112			2111
dry "other"		b1bb	bbb3			bbb3	 close to app in i3, deep in i4 and i2
dry dis1		1321	132b			122b
dry dis2		b2b3	b2b1			b2b2
xCys ~app		3434	?				3433
xCys ~dis		4343	?				4344


It looks like dry and xCys get trapped in sync -- in i2 both have a pgiC copy phased to a
~app tip that is phased to a ~dis tip in i3 (and probably in i4 too, but don't have xCysto
phasing summarized for that run)
