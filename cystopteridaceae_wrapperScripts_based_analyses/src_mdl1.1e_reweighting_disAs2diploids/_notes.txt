Modifying mdl1 to treat G.disjunctum at two diploids (instead of swapping it). Will just 
treat the copy1s as one individual, and the copy2s as another (although this doesn't agree
with how they are phased, quite)

Also going to increase the weights on the swaps for C.frag1, C.tas, and G.dry (manually, 
in the output from Matt's wrapper -- increasing them from w to 10w)
