Analysis descriptions:
	run1	-Four runs of mdl1 (before I renamed "run" to "mdl"), for 7k iterations
			-treeAssembly, branchlength hyperprior (0.004016), locus-specific rates
			
			-each converges to different distribution, run1c is the best
			-trees look ok, but the MCC and MAP summaries are super weird??
			-run1a full MCC and MCC of the pruned trees oddly different? Same with run1c (didn't check the others)--
				-the difference are in the vicinity of the BLANK in the full trees - this a bug of somesort?
						
	run2	-Four runs of mdl2 (before I renamed "run" to "mdl"), for 7k iterations
			-treeAssembly, branchlength hyperprior (0.004016), locus-specific rates
			
			-as with run1, converge to different distributions
			-trees and MCC, MAP, look fine (maybe because this mdl has no entirely-blank non-swapping tips?)
			
	mdl1a	-MCMCMC, four chains, one run, mdl1
			-treeAssembly, branchlength hyperprior (0.004016), locus-specific rates
			
			-Didn't do as well as run1c
			-Summary trees weird (Acystopteris all with ~0 length branches?)
			-But the individual tree samples look fine??? (so a similar issue to that seen in run1 summary trees)
			-pruned trees logged, but no MCC or MAP produced for them?? (and no error to indicate why not)
			
	mdl1b	-Four runs of mdl1, for 7k iterations
			-dnUniformTopologyBranchLength, branchlength hyperprior (0.004), locus-specific rates
			
			-similar traces to run1, although mdl1b1 slightly outperformed run1c
			-pruned trees logged, but no MCC or MAP produced for them?? (and no error to indicate why not)
			-the summary trees (for the full tree) look fine! weird
			
	mdl1d	-Four runs of mdl1, for 7k iterations
			-dnUniformTopologyBranchLength, branchlength hyperprior (0.004), but no locus-specific rates
			
			-as above - didn't converge, trees look ok, no MCC or MAP produced for the pruned trees
			
	mdl1.1e	-Four runs of mdl1.1 (disjunctum treated as two diploids instead of swapping copies between the tips)
			-Weights for the phase parameter moves increased to 10*w for the misbehaving ones (C.frag sp1, C.tas, G.dry)
			
			-Didn't converge. 1.1e3 was the best.
			-The previous misbehavers were all good, but now G.con, rob, and rem are messed up
			
	mdl1.1f	-increased weights for G.rem, rob, and con, too
			-didn't converge. 1.1f4 is the best (bad for 2k generations, then a big jump). next best is 1.1f1, which got good quickly but never made the additional hope to the 1.1f4 distrbution
	
	mdl1.1g	-Four runs of mdl1.1, but no locus-specific rates
			-still didn't converge, but maybe more runs got closer? only one was really off
			-run2 was the best
		
	mdl1.1h -like 1.1g, but with all phase moves upweighted x10
			-runs super slow, no convergence after 1000 iterations (everyting looks stable it its own distribution)
			-run1 is best (and better than 1.1g2)
			
	mdl1.2i	-dropped C.frag sp2, in the hope that that would allow better convergence (avoid
				getting stuck due to interactions between C.frag sp2 and xCysto)
			-didn't work (each converged to its own distribution, again)
			
	mdl1.3j -instead, dropped G.dry and xCysto (all the accessions with >2 subgenomes)
			
Summary -- moreorless where we started -- the runs converge to different distributions. Need 
				to check the phasing to see if there's something going on there that's noticeable			
Issues 	-- why the weirdness with the MAP and MCC trees in the mdl1 runs?
		-- why are there no MAP or MCC trees produced from the pruned trees in the mdl1a and mdl1b runs?
