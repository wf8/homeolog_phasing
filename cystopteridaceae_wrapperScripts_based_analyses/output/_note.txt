Analysis descriptions:
	run1	-Four runs of mdl1 (before I renamed "run" to "mdl"), for 7k iterations
			-treeAssembly, branchlength hyperprior (0.004016), locus-specific rates
			
			-each converges to different distribution, run1c is the best
			-trees look ok, but the MCC and MAP summaries are super weird??
			-run1a full MCC and MCC of the pruned trees oddly different? Same with run1c (didn't check the others)--
				-the difference are in the vicinity of the BLANK in the full trees - this a bug of somesort?
						
	run2	-Four runs of mdl2 (before I renamed "run" to "mdl"), for 7k iterations
			-treeAssembly, branchlength hyperprior (0.004016), locus-specific rates
			
			-as with run1, converge to different distributions
			-trees and MCC, MAP, look fine (maybe because this mdl has no entirely-blank non-swapping tips?)
			
	mdl1a	-MCMCMC, four chains, one run, mdl1
			-treeAssembly, branchlength hyperprior (0.004016), locus-specific rates
			
			-Didn't do as well as run1c
			-Summary trees weird (Acystopteris all with ~0 length branches?)
			-But the individual tree samples look fine??? (so a similar issue to that seen in run1 summary trees)
			-pruned trees logged, but no MCC or MAP produced for them?? (and no error to indicate why not)
			
	mdl1b	-Four runs of mdl1, for 7k iterations
			-dnUniformTopologyBranchLength, branchlength hyperprior (0.004), locus-specific rates
			
			-similar traces to run1, although mdl1b1 slightly outperformed run1c
			-pruned trees logged, but no MCC or MAP produced for them?? (and no error to indicate why not)
			-the summary trees (for the full tree) look fine! weird
			
	mdl1d	-Four runs of mdl1, for 7k iterations
			-dnUniformTopologyBranchLength, branchlength hyperprior (0.004), but no locus-specific rates
			
			-as above - didn't converge, trees look ok, no MCC or MAP produced for the pruned trees
			
			
			
Summary -- moreorless where we started -- the runs converge to different distributions. Need 
				to check the phasing to see if there's something going on there that's noticeable			
Issues 	-- why the weirdness with the MAP and MCC trees in the mdl1 runs?
		-- why are there no MAP or MCC trees produced from the pruned trees in the mdl1a and mdl1b runs?
