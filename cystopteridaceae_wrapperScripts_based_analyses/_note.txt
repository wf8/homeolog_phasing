Redoing the Cystopteridaceae analyses with:
	a) Matt's scripts (to make writing the methods easier?)
	b) Updated analyses settings (avoiding vague priors), to hopefully get better results 
	but more importantly, to help the stepping stone analyses converge
	

For the different runs, need to set the unswapped samples to their own accession, in the copyMap
except that only handles polyploids, so need to add the dummies to the alignments manually (in rev) 
before running the homologizer runs. So that they are in the dataset (alongside the diploids). 
Then I can use the copyMap to treat those sequences as belonging to a polyploid or omit them, 
in which case they'll be treated as a diploid (ie, theywon't be swapped to)

So created aligns_cystop/ for these new alignments (that include the dummy tip sequences for G.dry
and C.tas)
